## Tips for Effective Command Usage

### 1. Be Conversational
The AI understands natural language. Instead of `jam 915 mhz`, you can say:
- "Can you jam the frequency at 915 megahertz?"
- "I need to block signals at 915 MHz"
- "Please start jamming 915"

### 2. Combine Commands
You can chain operations:
- "Go offline, enable stealth, and start counter surveillance"
- "Scan wifi, then deauth the strongest network"

### 3. Ask Questions
The AI will explain what it's doing:
- "What does IMSI catching do?"
- "Explain the difference between GSM and LTE base stations"
- "Is it safe to enable this feature?"

### 4. Get Confirmation
Dangerous operations require confirmation:
- AI: "This will jam all cellular signals. Confirm? (yes/no)"
- You: "yes" or "no"

### 5. Check Status Frequently
- "What's currently running?"
- "Am I still in stealth mode?"
- "What's my current anonymity level?"

---

## Safety Reminders

1. **Always operate in OFFLINE mode** unless network access is required
2. **Enable stealth mode** before any RF operations
3. **Check OPSEC score** regularly
4. **Use beginner mode** if you're new to the system
5. **Know your emergency commands** - `panic` and `rf kill`
6. **Never operate without authorization**
